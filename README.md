# Movies-Correlation-Portfolio-Project
In this Project Using Python I have taken Movies dataset and checked for the degree of correlation amongs various fields and deduced conclusions after plotting.
Correlation shows the strength of a relationship between two variables and is expressed numerically by the correlation coefficient. 
The correlation coefficient's values range between -1.0 and 1.0.
A perfect positive correlation means that the correlation coefficient is exactly 1. 
This implies that as one security moves, either up or down, the other security moves in lockstep, in the same direction. 
A perfect negative correlation means that two assets move in opposite directions, while a zero correlation implies no linear relationship at all.
